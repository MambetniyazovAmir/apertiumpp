@title{Apertium++, or Apertium 4.0}

This is a project with an aim of:

@itemlist[

 @item{making a free/libre morphological transducer for every language
  of the world;}

 @item{making free/libre machine translators for translating between
  @bold{all} related languages of a particular language group
  (e.g. Turkic, Slavic, Indo-Iranian etc;)}

 @item{updating Apertium 3.0's official documentation so that it
  reflects changes which have happened since the time of its publication;}

 @item{reducing the code which developers have to maintain
  in a typical Apertium 3.0 monolingual or bilingual package.}]

@margin-note{Hence two pluses in the name of the project...}

The project, in its spirit and aims is similar to the
@hyperlink["https://www.apertium.org"]{Apertium project}, and can be
considered its spinoff, with two additions:

@itemlist[

 @item{for each language, we will maintain a corpus of sharable texts,
  parallel or comparable to corpora for other languges}

 @item{machine translators will have a speech recognition & speech synthesis
  front-ends (based on Mozilla's Common Voice and DeepSpeech projects).}]

@margin-note{To be frank, if we come up with some useful technology,
 we hope to see it merged to the Apertium's code base.}

Since one of the declared goals of ours is being able to handle speech (not
just the written word), and, since we want to re-evaluate some of the design
decisions made in the Apertium project (and yet are not sure at all whether
such re-evaluations will turn out to be wise desicions), we decided to make a
separate project out of this effort.

@section{What could be improved in Apertium 3.0?}

Apertium is a great project, with quite a few contributors, but here is a list of things deemed as less-than-optimal in the current Apertium setup:

@itemlist[

 @item{transfer rules are unidirectional, and currently there is no way of
  marking a transfer rule as `bidirectional' and get a transfer rule for the
  opposite direction for free,}

 @item{there can be and usually there are several entries in a .lexc or .dix
  files with the same left-hand side (and there is no compile-time checks against
  mistakenly adding the same word twice, possibly with a right and a wrong
  category}

 @item{rather long compile cycles, translators are not extensible
  programmatically}

 @item{?}]
